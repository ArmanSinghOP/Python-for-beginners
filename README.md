# Learning_python


Here i'm learning the basics of Python programming and exploring various data types and essential libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy. The project aims to provide hands-on experience with Python's core concepts and commonly used data manipulation and visualization libraries.


## Installation

Additionally, the project utilizes several external libraries, including Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy. These libraries can be installed using pip, the Python package manager. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```shell
pip install matplotlib pandas numpy
```


## Data Types

The project covers various data types in Python, including:

- Numeric types: int, float
- Boolean type: bool
- Sequence types: str, list, tuple
- Mapping type: dict
- Set types: set

## Libraries

This project focuses on the usage of the following essential libraries:

1. Matplotlib: A popular data visualization library that provides a wide range of plotting options, enabling the creation of various charts, graphs, and visualizations.

2. Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. Pandas provides data structures and functions to efficiently handle structured data, perform data cleaning, filtering, aggregation, and more.

3. NumPy: A fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. NumPy provides support for handling large, multi-dimensional arrays and a collection of mathematical functions for efficient numerical operations.

Happy coding!
